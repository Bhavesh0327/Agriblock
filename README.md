**Agriblock is a blockchain based Progressive Web App intends to help the agriculture industry and day to day consumer from various price hikes or you can say blackmarketing of goods by reserving  the stocks of a particular good and selling at higher rates , it also ensures the proper transaction of product and money between producer and consumer. Through this single app the malfunctioning of the  whole supply chain system will be eliminated to certain extent.**

**This blockchain based agriculture solution holds a lot of promise for the agribusiness industry with its ability to bring transparency in the system , where user can track the good's movement from producer to the consumer, and no single body can do malfunctionung or stocks reserving .** 


# How it works ?

**We have used Blockchain underhood the whole process ,at each level system can detect the error in the amount of the good produced and transfered from one level to another.* And nobody can do an invalid transaction.**

# How it will help consumers ?


 **The supply chain of agriculture goods not only includes producer to consumer but also includes the RATION SYSTEM that is one among the most corrupted system in India. To overcome this , Agriblock can help government to have a tight hand over the  Ration distribution system in India. Where each level has a condition to check the validity of the chain interms of transactions**
 
 # How  farmers will use it ?
 **we have made this App from farmer's point of view , we have simplified the whole UI/Ux system in  such a way that with   single  click the farmer can do the whole transaction process with full ease and security.**
